# Python Lessons: Control Flow, Collections & Sets

## Overview
This repository contains Python examples covering key concepts related to control flow, loops, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and frozensets. These examples provide a basic understanding of how to use these data structures and control statements in Python.

## Lessons Covered

### **Lesson 05: Control Flow & Loops**
- **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- **Loops** (`for`, `while`)
- **Loop Control** (`break`, `continue`)

### **Lesson 06: Lists, Tuples & Dictionary**
- **Lists** (Dynamic, ordered collection with modification capabilities)
- **Tuples** (Immutable sequences)
- **Dictionaries** (Key-value pairs for efficient data storage and retrieval)

### **Lesson 07: The Set & Frozenset**
- **Sets** (Unordered collection of unique elements)
- **Set Operations** (`union`, `intersection`, `difference`)
- **Frozensets** (Immutable version of sets)

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3+ recommended).
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```sh
