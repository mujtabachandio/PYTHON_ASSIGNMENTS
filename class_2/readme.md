# Python Operators

This project contains a Python script demonstrating different types of operators in Python.

## Operators Covered

1. **Arithmetic Operators** - Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
2. **Assignment Operators** - Assign values to variables with different shorthand notations.
3. **Comparison Operators** - Compare values and return Boolean results.
4. **Logical Operators** - Perform logical operations (`and`, `or`, `not`).
5. **Identity Operators** - Check if two objects refer to the same memory location.
6. **Membership Operators** - Test for membership in sequences like lists and strings.
7. **Bitwise Operators** - Perform bit-level operations.

## How to Run the Script

1. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python3 index.py
   ```

## Expected Output
The script prints various results demonstrating the usage of different operators.
