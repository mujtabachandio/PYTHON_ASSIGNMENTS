## 1. Python Data Types & Special Keywords

In this section, you will learn about various **data types** used in Python. These include:

- **Integers (`int`)**: Whole numbers like 5, 10, etc.
- **Floats (`float`)**: Decimal numbers like 3.14, 2.5, etc.
- **Strings (`str`)**: Text or sequences of characters like `"Hello World"`.
- **Booleans (`bool`)**: Represent `True` or `False` values.
- **Lists (`list`)**: Ordered, mutable collections of items.
- **Tuples (`tuple`)**: Ordered, immutable collections of items.
- **Dictionaries (`dict`)**: Key-value pairs, like `{"key": "value"}`.
- **Sets (`set`)**: Unordered collections of unique items.
- **None**: A special type representing the absence of a value.

### Special Keywords in Python:
Python has reserved **keywords** that are part of the language syntax, such as `if`, `else`, `for`, `def`, and `return`. These keywords cannot be used as variable names.

## 2. Explore Google Colab

### What is Google Colab?
**Google Colab** is an interactive, cloud-based notebook environment where you can run Python code directly in your browser without needing to install anything on your local machine. Itâ€™s based on Jupyter notebooks and is widely used for data science, machine learning, and Python learning.

Google Colab offers several key benefits:
- **Free cloud-based environment**: No need for installations.
- **Runs Python code**: Execute Python scripts directly in the browser.
- **GPU & TPU support**: You can access free GPUs and TPUs for heavy computation tasks, such as training machine learning models.
- **Easy sharing**: You can share your notebooks with others and collaborate in real-time.

### Why Use Google Colab?
- **Collaboration**: Google Colab allows for real-time collaboration with others. You can share your notebook with classmates or colleagues and work together.
- **No setup required**: You don't need to worry about installing Python or any dependencies.
- **Free access to powerful resources**: Google Colab provides free access to computing resources like GPUs and TPUs, which are especially useful for machine learning and data science tasks.

### Resource:

### Getting Started with Google Colab:
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. You can create a new notebook by clicking on **File > New Notebook**.
3. Start writing Python code in the code cells and run them to see the output.
4. Use the **GPU/TPU** option for accelerated computations (available in **Runtime > Change runtime type**).
